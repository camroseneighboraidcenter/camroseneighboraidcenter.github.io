Our Food for Kids program, established in 2000, operates in partnership with six local schools to ensure that no child starts their day hungry. Through our breakfast clubs, we provide nutritious morning meals that help students focus on learning rather than hunger.

### Program Goals
- Ensure no child starts school hungry
